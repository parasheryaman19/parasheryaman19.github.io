  <!-- What is srl -->

  <p style="text-align:justify"> In the lab, I was assigned to develop a high reflective GeSn based resonant cavity structure in the SWIR(1800nm - 2400nm) region which can be used to design various optoelectronics devices like VCSELs, photodetectors, RCLEDs for several applications in the sensing domain. </p> 
  <p><img src="/projectmaterial/material/Taiwan4.jpeg" rotate="180" /> <em><center>Figure: Internship Certificate</em></p>&nbsp
  <p style="text-align:justify">For the purpose, I took forward the work of one of my labmate Mr. Bo-Jun into the Multiphysics simulation environment of COMSOL to develop and evaluate various test cases of the cavity structure under different analysis techniques to get the most optimized structure for better results. Apart from this, I have also developed expertise in working with fabrication processes like Photolithography and RIE(Reactive Ion Etching) for various MEMS-based applications in the given tenure here at CCU.</p>&nbsp
<p style="text-align:justify">Now Talking about my labmates. My lab-mates are what distinguished my Taiwan experience from that of the other interns here. Since the very moment I arrived in the lab, they have ensured that I had the best time. Taking me to new restaurants every day, translating menus for me, teaching me Chinese words, driving me to visit nearby cities, helping me plan my weekend trips; the list of favors they have done for me is simply endless. One of them(Tim) even lent me his bicycle for the internship period.They are a really entertaining bunch of brainy minds who often put their limited English vocabulary to the most hilarious use. Our professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xbWTDI8AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW">Dr. Guo-en Chang</a> is also very enthusiastic and friendly. Throughout the research tenure, he keeps on motivating me whenever I got stuck with something in the work. His regular appreciation is what actually made me work harder day and night irrespective of any Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
&nbsp
 <p><img src="/projectmaterial/material/Taiwan2.png" /> <em><center>Figure: Lab-mates  </center></em></p>
 <p style="text-align:justify">Talking about the Taiwanese people, they have a very friendly and hospitable attitude. They are always willing to help out whenever I got stuck with some problems. They are very quiet and soft-spoken. To be honest, here, I have met the most disciplined, punctual, honest, humble, and gentle people I have ever come across in my entire life so far. That's the main reason I guess why Taiwan is considered a paradise for technological innovations in comparison to the rest of the world. The dedication of these people toward their work is incomparable.</p>
